Welcome to my Machine Learning Project Repository!

This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning and building machine learning projects.
I’ll continue to upload more ML projects here over time — stay tuned! 🌟

🏠 House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)
The first project in this repository is a House Price Prediction model.
It predicts the price of houses based on various features using a Linear Regression algorithm.

### Files
## house_price_prediction.py — Python script that:

Reads the dataset (USA_Housing.csv)

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Splits data into training and testing sets

Trains a Linear Regression model

Evaluates the model and prints metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score

 ###Dataset: USA_Housing.csv (make sure to place it in the same folder)

## Output
The script performs the following:

Visualizes relationships and distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Trains a linear regression model with scikit-learn

Evaluates predictions and plots residuals

Prints evaluation metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Sample Output:
