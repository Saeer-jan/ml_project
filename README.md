#### Machine Learning Projects Repository
## Welcome to my Machine Learning Project Repository!

This repository documents my journey in learning and building machine learning projects. Here I implement, experiment, and share a variety of ML models with datasets — all in the spirit of learning and growth.

I’ll continue to add more projects over time — stay tuned! 🌟

### Projects So Far
## House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)
A Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on various features.

Features:
✅ Reads the dataset (USA_Housing.csv)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
✅ Splits data into training & testing sets
✅ Trains a Linear Regression model
✅ Evaluates with metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score
✅ Plots residuals & relationships

### Advertising Click Prediction (Logistic Regression)
A Logistic Regression model that predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement based on demographics and behavior.

### Features:
✅ Reads the dataset (advertising.csv)
✅ Handles categorical variables and encodes them
✅ EDA with histograms, jointplots, pairplots, heatmaps
✅ Trains and evaluates a Logistic Regression model
✅ Displays confusion matrix and classification report
✅ Visualizes model coefficients
✅ Saves trained model as logistic_regression_model.pkl

### Technologies Used
